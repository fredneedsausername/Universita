# University Course Notes

## About These Notes

A significant portion of my course studies from these notes, and I've been fortunate to receive numerous compliments from fellow students who have found them particularly useful for their own learning.

This repository contains my university course notes, written entirely in **LaTeX** â€” a document preparation system widely used in academia for producing high-quality technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX excels at typesetting mathematical formulas, creating structured documents, and maintaining consistent formatting throughout complex materials.

## Why LaTeX?

I chose to write my notes in LaTeX for two primary reasons:

### 1. **Organization and Clarity**
LaTeX allows me to create highly structured, professionally formatted notes that are easy to navigate and study from. The clear hierarchy of sections, well-formatted mathematical expressions, and consistent styling make reviewing material much more efficient than traditional handwritten notes.

### 2. **Digital Integration with AI**
By digitalizing my notes in a structured format, I can leverage modern AI tools (LLMs) to analyze the content and generate personalized practice exercises based on the specific topics covered in class. This creates a dynamic study resource that goes beyond passive review, allowing for targeted practice on areas that need reinforcement.

## Compiling the LaTeX Files

If you'd like to compile these `.tex` files into PDFs yourself, there are many online tutorials and guides available that explain how to set up a LaTeX environment on your computer. A quick search will lead you to various resources for your specific operating system.
